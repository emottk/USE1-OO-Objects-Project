#Making a Game with OO

With a partner, you will be creating a rock paper scissor game. You should have a class that creates a new game, and has all the functionality of the game that we know and love.     

It should initialize with two players, have an attr_reader, and a fun message when someone wins or loses.   

If you finish, make a player class! Make this player have a lot of fun attributes, and find a way to use one of them during your game. The player must at least initialize with a name, but you can add more if you'd like!
